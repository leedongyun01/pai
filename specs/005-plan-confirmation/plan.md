# Implementation Plan: Human-in-the-Loop Interaction (Plan Confirmation)

**Branch**: `005-plan-confirmation` | **Date**: 2026-01-15 | **Spec**: [specs/005-plan-confirmation/spec.md]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implementation of the Human-in-the-Loop interaction pattern for research planning. This feature allows users to review, edit, and provide feedback on research plans generated by the agent. It includes a "review_pending" state, feedback-driven plan regeneration, manual task overrides, and an Auto-Pilot mode toggle.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x (Next.js 16 environment)
**Primary Dependencies**: `ai` (Vercel AI SDK), `@ai-sdk/google` (Gemini), `zod`, `lucide-react`
**Storage**: Local Filesystem JSON (`.data/sessions/`)
**Testing**: `vitest`
**Target Platform**: Web (Next.js App Router)
**Project Type**: Web application
**Performance Goals**: Plan regeneration < 5s, Initial UI response < 200ms
**Constraints**: Indefinite persistence of "review_pending" state; explicit warning before overwriting manual edits with feedback-driven regeneration.
**Scale/Scope**: Session state machine extension, Planner agent enhancement, and new API endpoints for feedback/approval.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

| Principle | Adherence |
|-----------|-----------|
| I. Autonomous Execution | Supported via "Auto-Pilot" mode which skips confirmation. |
| II. Verifiable Reliability | Enhanced by allowing humans to steer the agent towards better sources/plans. |
| III. Adaptive Visualization | Plan steps will be visualized as a structured, interactive list. |
| IV. Dual-Mode Operation | Confirmation is mandatory for 'Deep Probe', optional for 'Quick Scan' (via Auto-Pilot). |
| V. Human-in-the-Loop | This feature is the primary implementation of Principle V. |

**Structure Decision**: Single project (DEFAULT). We are extending the existing Next.js App Router structure.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
